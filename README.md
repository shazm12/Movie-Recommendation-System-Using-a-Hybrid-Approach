# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-a-Hybrid-Approach

The problem I have picked for the project is to design and train an efficient movie recommendation model which will recommend movies to users based on the User interaction matrix which would contain the user details with the movies the users liked and vice versa. Also, I will design another model which will recommend movies based on the context, title, genre, and such other attributes of the movies liked by the user and would recommend similar movies to the user.
